This portfolio includes revised solutions to projects 1 and 3. These projects
were chosen because the results attained in project 2 were not very
interesting, and the received peer-evaluation of project 2 did not reveal any
severe problems with our approach.

This portfolio includes the peer-evaluations received for projects 1 and 3. A
discussion of how each project was modified, and how the peer-evaluations were
addressed are included in the respective project appendices. The projects were
modified in accordance with both received peer-evaluations, and personal
evaluations.

This portfolio also includes the author's peer-evaluations of projects 1 and 2.
These peer-evaluations were chosen because they seemingly provide more useful
feedback than the third. The peer evaluation for project 3 mainly concentrated
on the lacks of the task list shown to users, which is pointless to change
after the user tests have been conducted.
