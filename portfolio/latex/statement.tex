This portfolio includes revised solutions to projects 1 and 3. These projects
were chosen because the results attained in project 2 were not very
interesting, and the received peer-evaluation of project 2 did not reveal any
severe problems with our approach.

This portfolio includes the peer-evaluations received for projects 1 and 3. A
discussion of how each project was revised, and how the peer-evaluations were
addressed are included in the respective project appendices. The projects were
revised in accordance with both received peer-evaluations, and personal
evaluations.

This portfolio also includes the author's peer-evaluations of anonymous
solutions to projects 1 and 2.  These peer-evaluations were chosen because they
seemingly provide more useful feedback than the third. The peer evaluation for
project 3 mainly concentrated on the lacks of the task list shown to users,
which is pointless to change after the user tests have been conducted.
