The code is included in Appendix \ref{appendix:3} (p. \pageref{appendix:3}).
The assignment text seems ambiguous about when to perform the normalisation.
According to a forum post on the course web site\footnotemark, normalisation
should be done on all nodes before a subsequent iteration. This is at odds with
the requirement that all nodes start with an initial score of $0.45$, as this
is not normalised. I decided normalise the initial score to $0.2$.

The code prints the page rank after every iteration. The final results are:

\begin{lstlisting}
Yahoo(0.175016)
Bing(0.207459)
Facebook(0.185005)
Google(0.193215)
Twitter(0.239304)
\end{lstlisting}
