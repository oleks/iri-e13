\section{Revision}

Applied changes suggested by the peer-review, or out of personal
considerations:

\begin{itemize}

\item Some grammatical errors fixed.

\item Some minor clarifications added.

\item A clarification of how the mean number of queries per user id is
computed.

\item An additional analysis of the mean number of queries issued by those
users that perform less than 10 queries. This is 95\% of all users.

\item Changed the query length analysis to be based on words rather than
characters.

\end{itemize}

Changes suggested by the peer-review, but not applied:

\begin{itemize}

\item The suggested change to go from third person pronouns to first person
pronouns was not applied. This is due to the author's stylistic preferences
wrt. academic writing.

\end{itemize}
