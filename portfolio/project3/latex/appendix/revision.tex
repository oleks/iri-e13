\section{Revision}

Applied changes suggested by the peer-review, or out of personal
considerations:

\begin{itemize}

\item Some grammatical errors fixed.

\item Some minor clarifications added.

\item The choice of the Google Chrome browser justified.

\item Added a note that the test user behaviour may be influenced by them being
aware that screen recording is taking place.

\item Added a description of the test users chosen.

\item Made a more clear distinction between the introduction of the test and
the actual tasks, as presented to the test user.

\item Added a not that videos on YouTube can be watched at double speed.

\item Another good feature was added to the list which has to do with the
search term suggestions on \texttt{amazon.com}. This was observed by reviewing
the screen recordings.

\end{itemize}

Changes suggested by the peer-review, but not applied:

\begin{itemize}

\item Suggestions relating to the tasks and the conducting of user tests were
considered, but not applied as the user tests had already taken place.

\item The time per task were not deduced from the videos as suggested by the
peer review. This did not seem to provide any additional information since
neither test took unexpectedly long, and no severe anomalies in times per task
were observed.

\end{itemize}
